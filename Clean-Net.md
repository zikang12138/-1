# Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization through Contrast based Evaluation Networks
**以往的方法：**Currently, many existing WS-TAL methods [21, 23, 32,37] localize actions *by directly thresholding* the classification score of each snippet.   
**提出方法：**We propose a Contrast-based Localization EvaluAtioN Network (CleanNet) for WS-TAL, which leverages the tem- poral contrast cue among action classification predictions of snippets for action proposal evaluation  
**模块：**Snippet-level Classifica- tion Predictions (SCP) and Snippet-level Attention Predic- tions (SAP)
